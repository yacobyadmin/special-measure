Becuase Vaunix has their heads too far up their a**s to provide a 64 bit DLL, we now bypass their DLL entirely and talk to the labbrick directly.  
We use HIDAPI to do this because directly using microsofts HID DLL is quite complex, esp. from MATLAB.

See http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/

n.b. ; we provide pre-compiled 32 and 64 bit versions of the library here.
